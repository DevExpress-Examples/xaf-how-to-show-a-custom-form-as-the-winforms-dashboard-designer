# XAF - How to show a custom form as a WinForms Dashboard Designer

This example describes how to display a custom form as a WinForms Dashboard Designer that is used to create and modify dashboards in WinForms XAF applications. This can be required for menu customization. For example, you may need to add custom BarItems or remove default BarItems.

## Implementation Details

1. Add a newÂ [XtraForm](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraForm)Â orÂ [RibbonForm](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonForm)Â to the project.
2. AddÂ [DashboardDesigner](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner)Â to the newly created form as it is described in theÂ following topic: [Create a WinForms Dashboard Designer (.NET Framework)](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/12137/get-started/build-winforms-dashboard-applications/create-a-winforms-dashboard-designer-in-net-framework).
3. Add a property of the `DashboardDesigner` type to the custom form.
4. In the Windows Forms module, add a Controller that is activated in theÂ [IDashboardData](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.Persistent.Base.IDashboardData)Â Views only.
5. Access theÂ `WinShowDashboardDesignerController`Â using theÂ [Frame.GetController<ControllerType>](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.Frame.GetControllers(System.Type))Â method.
6. Access theÂ `DashboardDesignerManager`Â object using theÂ `WinShowDashboardDesignerController.DashboardDesignerManager`Â property.
7. Handle theÂ `DashboardDesignerManager.CreateCustomForm`Â event. Create and assign aÂ custom `XtraForm` to theÂ `CreateCustomFormEventArgs.Form`Â property.
